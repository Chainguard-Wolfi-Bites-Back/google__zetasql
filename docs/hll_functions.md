The [HyperLogLog++ algorithm (HLL++)][hll-sketches] estimates
[cardinality][cardinality] from [sketches][hll-sketches].

HLL++ functions are approximate aggregate functions.
Approximate aggregation typically requires less
memory than exact aggregation functions,
like [`COUNT(DISTINCT)`][count-distinct], but also introduces statistical error.
This makes HLL++ functions appropriate for large data streams for
which linear memory usage is impractical, as well as for data that is
already approximate.

If you do not need materialized sketches, you can alternatively use an
[approximate aggregate function with system-defined precision][approx-functions-reference],
such as [`APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT`][approx-count-distinct]. However,
`APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` does not allow partial aggregations, re-aggregations,
and custom precision.

ZetaSQL supports the following HLL++ functions:

### HLL_COUNT.INIT
```
HLL_COUNT.INIT(input [, precision])
```

**Description**

An aggregate function that takes one or more `input` values and aggregates them
into a [HLL++][hll-link-to-research-whitepaper] sketch. Each sketch
is represented using the `BYTES` data type. You can then merge sketches using
`HLL_COUNT.MERGE` or `HLL_COUNT.MERGE_PARTIAL`. If no merging is needed,
you can extract the final count of distinct values from the sketch using
`HLL_COUNT.EXTRACT`.

This function supports an optional parameter, `precision`. This parameter
defines the accuracy of the estimate at the cost of additional memory required
to process the sketches or store them on disk. The range for this value is
`10` to `24`. The default value is `15`. For more information about precision,
see [Precision for sketches][precision].

If the input is `NULL`, this function returns `NULL`.

For more information, see [HyperLogLog in Practice: Algorithmic Engineering of
a State of The Art Cardinality Estimation Algorithm][hll-link-to-research-whitepaper].

**Supported input types**

+ `INT64`
+ `UINT64`
+ `NUMERIC`
+ `BIGNUMERIC`
+ `STRING`
+ `BYTES`

**Return type**

`BYTES`

**Example**

```sql
SELECT
  HLL_COUNT.INIT(respondent) AS respondents_hll,
  flavor,
  country
FROM UNNEST([
  STRUCT(1 AS respondent, "Vanilla" AS flavor, "CH" AS country),
  (1, "Chocolate", "CH"),
  (2, "Chocolate", "US"),
  (2, "Strawberry", "US")])
GROUP BY flavor, country;
```

### HLL_COUNT.MERGE
```
HLL_COUNT.MERGE(sketch)
```

**Description**

An aggregate function that returns the cardinality of several
[HLL++][hll-link-to-research-whitepaper] set sketches by computing their union.

Each `sketch` must be initialized on the same type. Attempts to merge sketches
for different types results in an error. For example, you cannot merge a sketch
initialized from `INT64` data with one initialized from `STRING` data.

If the merged sketches were initialized with different precisions, the precision
will be downgraded to the lowest precision involved in the merge.

This function ignores `NULL` values when merging sketches. If the merge happens
over zero rows or only over `NULL` values, the function returns `0`.

**Supported input types**

`BYTES`

**Return type**

`INT64`

**Example**

```sql
SELECT HLL_COUNT.MERGE(respondents_hll) AS num_respondents, flavor
FROM (
  SELECT
    HLL_COUNT.INIT(respondent) AS respondents_hll,
    flavor,
    country
  FROM UNNEST([
    STRUCT(1 AS respondent, "Vanilla" AS flavor, "CH" AS country),
    (1, "Chocolate", "CH"),
    (2, "Chocolate", "US"),
    (2, "Strawberry", "US")])
  GROUP BY flavor, country)
GROUP BY flavor;
```

### HLL_COUNT.MERGE_PARTIAL
```
HLL_COUNT.MERGE_PARTIAL(sketch)
```

**Description**

An aggregate function that takes one or more
[HLL++][hll-link-to-research-whitepaper] `sketch`
inputs and merges them into a new sketch.

Each `sketch` must be initialized on the same type. Attempts to merge sketches
for different types results in an error. For example, you cannot merge a sketch
initialized from `INT64` data with one initialized from `STRING` data.

If the merged sketches were initialized with different precisions, the precision
will be downgraded to the lowest precision involved in the merge. For example,
if `MERGE_PARTIAL` encounters sketches of precision 14 and 15, the returned new
sketch will have precision 14.

This function returns `NULL` if there is no input or all inputs are `NULL`.

**Supported input types**

`BYTES`

**Return type**

`BYTES`

**Example**

```sql
SELECT HLL_COUNT.MERGE_PARTIAL(respondents_hll) AS num_respondents, flavor
FROM (
  SELECT
    HLL_COUNT.INIT(respondent) AS respondents_hll,
    flavor,
    country
  FROM UNNEST([
    STRUCT(1 AS respondent, "Vanilla" AS flavor, "CH" AS country),
    (1, "Chocolate", "CH"),
    (2, "Chocolate", "US"),
    (2, "Strawberry", "US")])
  GROUP BY flavor, country)
GROUP BY flavor;
```

### HLL_COUNT.EXTRACT
```
HLL_COUNT.EXTRACT(sketch)
```

**Description**

A scalar function that extracts a cardinality estimate of a single
[HLL++][hll-link-to-research-whitepaper] sketch.

If `sketch` is `NULL`, this function returns a cardinality estimate of `0`.

**Supported input types**

`BYTES`

**Return type**

`INT64`

**Example**

```sql
SELECT
  flavor,
  country,
  HLL_COUNT.EXTRACT(respondents_hll) AS num_respondents
FROM (
  SELECT
    HLL_COUNT.INIT(respondent) AS respondents_hll,
    flavor,
    country
  FROM UNNEST([
    STRUCT(1 AS respondent, "Vanilla" AS flavor, "CH" AS country),
    (1, "Chocolate", "CH"),
    (2, "Chocolate", "US"),
    (2, "Strawberry", "US")])
  GROUP BY flavor, country);

+------------+---------+-----------------+
| flavor     | country | num_respondents |
+------------+---------+-----------------+
| Vanilla    | CH      | 1               |
| Chocolate  | CH      | 1               |
| Chocolate  | US      | 1               |
| Strawberry | US      | 1               |
+------------+---------+-----------------+
